Comments:

Server side (on branch server):
- implemented graphQL schema
- implemented resolvers
- Modified employee class for id to be part of constructor
- modified java version of gradle build (from 21 to 17)
- test function can cause errors with build (in that case build and skip running tests)

Client side (on branch client):
- modified employee service to match with server schema
- modified package.json to resolve existing dependency conflicts in starter code
